# hello-world
My first repository
I am a PhD student in Chemical Engineering. I do stochastic modeling and simulation for my PhD research. I am interested in building my coding skills, learning new languages, and learning new algorithms and statistical techniques. I am excited to join GitHub and see and share projects.
