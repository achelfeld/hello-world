# hello-world
My first repository

I am a PhD graduate in Chemical Engineering. In my academic research, I built stochastic models to understand random and deterministic phenomena in colloidal science, with applications in materials assembly. 
Currently, I am a modeling and simulation professional in health economics. 
I am interested in building my coding skills, learning new languages, and new algorithms and statistical techniques, particularly in the field of health economics. I am excited to be a part of GitHub and see and share projects.
